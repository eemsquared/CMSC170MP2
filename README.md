# CMSC170MP2

The program will automatically perform the 10 iterations of K-mean given that
  K= 3
  m = 300
  mu1 = (3, 3)
  mu2 = (6, 2)
  mu3 = (8, 5)
  
Each iterations has iter_ca and iter_cm text files. The outputs of each iterations are written to both of these files.

Just run the program and opn separately the text files to see the results.
